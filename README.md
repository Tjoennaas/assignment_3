Assignment_3/Expense tracker app


The purpose of this assignment is to gain hands-on experience in utilizing React and grasp a deeper understanding of React fundamental concepts. The task is to create a simple “Expense Tracker App” using React. The application should allow users to enter data about their expenses, delete expenses, and it should display the registered expenses. 
I use the React library to create a expense tracker, the validation must be implemented so the user will have to enter all the categories in the form before it renders on the webpage. The expense date is stored in ISO 8601 format and each items have a dele button. The total amount of all the expenses is displayed as users add or delete.

Status: Working and stable. Form working according to criterias in the first section of this text.
Browser support: No known browser issues.
The webpage has responsive design suited  for bigger screens.
